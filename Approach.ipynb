        "This document outlines the approach for developing a video processing pipeline aimed at detecting brand logos, specifically Pepsi and Coca-Cola, in video footage and recording their timestamps. The project involves two main components: a Python script (timestamp.py) for extracting timestamps and a Jupyter Notebook (video.ipynb) for training a custom object detection model.\n",

        "The developed pipeline effectively detects and records timestamps for Pepsi and Coca-Cola logos in video footage. By utilizing YOLOv8, the project achieved high accuracy and efficient processing.

        "## Approaches Considered\n",
        "### 1. YOLOv8\n",
        "* Description: YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a single-stage object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv8 is the latest version with improvements in performance and ease of use.\n",
        "* Why Chosen: Familiarity with the YOLO framework and its ease of integration for real-time object detection tasks. YOLOv8 offers state-of-the-art performance with a good balance of speed and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Faster R-CNN\n",
        "* Description: Faster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection model that first proposes regions of interest and then classifies these regions.\n",
        "* Why Not Chosen: While it offers high accuracy, Faster R-CNN is slower and more computationally intensive, making it less suitable for processing videos in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Pre-trained Models on COCO Dataset\n",
        "* Description: Utilizing pre-trained models on the COCO dataset for object detection.\n",
        "* Why Not Chosen: Pre-trained models on COCO are not as specialized for detecting specific logos like Pepsi or CocaCola, potentially leading to lower accuracy in this specific application.\n",
